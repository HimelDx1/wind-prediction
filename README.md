# 🌬️ Wind Speed Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting wind speed using machine learning algorithms based on historical meteorological data. Accurate wind speed prediction is vital for wind energy forecasting, aviation safety, and climate research.

## 🔍 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess weather data
* Visualize trends and patterns in wind speed
* Train machine learning models to predict wind speed
* Evaluate and compare model performance

## 📁 Dataset

* **Source:** \[Specify the source, e.g., Kaggle or a local weather station]
* **Features:** Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind direction, etc.
* **Target:** Wind speed (m/s or km/h)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* (Optional) TensorFlow or XGBoost

## 📊 Data Visualization

The following plots were used:

* Time series plot of wind speed
* Histogram of wind speed distribution
* Correlation heatmap of features
* Box plots for feature analysis
* Actual vs. Predicted plot

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Decision Tree Regressor
* (Optional) LSTM or XGBoost

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

## ✅ Results

* The best performing model was: **\[Model Name]**
* Achieved RMSE of: **\[Value]**
* Visual comparison showed close match between predicted and actual values.
